# Orderpage
This project shows how to use HTML Forms and apply PHP programming to print out all the details passed from the form.


For every order, write to the file “orders.txt” the following output: 
“Name, Size and Price, Color, Credit Card Number \n” (in this project, name, size and price, etc are passed from the Forms).
